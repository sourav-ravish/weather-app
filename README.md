Weather-app is a web app to get the weather details of any place you enter in the form. This app was built by me primarily to learn NodeJS, Express and MongoDB.

It uses 2 APIs in the backend: 
1) To convert location text to location co-ordinates. 
2) To take location co-ordinates and fetch weather description and details. 

Deployed here: https://ravish-weather-application.herokuapp.com/

Please have a look and do open PRs for any suggestion/improvement.
